#### quote
_"Its combination of safety and speed make Swift an excellent choice for everything from “Hello, world!” to an entire operating system."_

### Swift

- clarity
- brevity as a side effect
- Names of types and protocols are `UpperCamelCase`. Everything else is `lowerCamelCase`.
- function variable names
- Code written at global scope is used as the entry point for the program, so you don’t need a `main()` function.


### Basic stuff
#### `var` vs le
1.  var myVariable = 42
2.  myVariable = 50
3.  let myConstant = 42
