My name is Luka ÄŒabraja, you may call me luka, i am a currently finishing up my bachelors degree in software engineering at algebra university college, 
i am very passionate about technology and believe it should never hamper any goal, rather it should make it possible, easier or improve it
it is for that reason that i started this company

the settlements that grew into the first cities had wide roads, to accomodate for large ammounts of foot traffic, next to hoofed traffic and later horse drawn carriages and it was all very much unregulated

when cars came along the city officials realized that cities should adapt more to cars, centuries later and the seeds they sew grew into 

the cities of the past changed and adapted to new technologies as they appeared, it is our goal to build the cities of the future



Email deserves to die,
don't get me wrong, it has served us well, but it's high time for it to go
as it has started to show more than just it's age
i'm talking about it's limitations
back in the good old days of computer science, it was very much the wild west in terms of software compatibility
things spontaneously worked, didn't work, caught fire all the time
